## Creating a Form on Formbase

1. **Log in to Formbase**: Go to [Formbase](https://www.formbase.dev) and log in to your account.
2. **Create a New Form**: Navigate to the dashboard and click on `New Form`.
3. **Configure the Form**: Add the fields you need and configure as required.
4. **Save the Form**: After configuring, save the form. You will be provided with a unique `Form ID`.

## Integrating Formbase into Your HTML

To embed your Formbase form into your HTML, follow these steps:

### Form Action and Enctype

1. **HTML Form Setup**: Insert the following code snippet into your HTML file, replacing `YOUR_FORM_ID` with the Form ID you received from Formbase.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Formbase Integration</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form
      id="formbase-form"
      action="https://formbase.dev/s/YOUR_FORM_ID"
      enctype="multipart/form-data"
      method="post"
    >
      <!-- Add your form fields here -->
      <input style="display: none" type="text" name="_gotcha" />
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Submitting Data with an Onsubmit Handler

To submit the form data using an `onsubmit` handler, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Onsubmit Handler**: Add the following JavaScript code snippet to your HTML file.

```html
<script>
  document.getElementById('formbase-form').onsubmit = async function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.target);
    const response = await fetch('https://formbase.dev/s/YOUR_FORM_ID', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  };
</script>
```
